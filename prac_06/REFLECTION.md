I have tried to become more methodical with the way I approach tasks, working on little bits slowly

Trying my hardest to understand 100% of everything about what I'm learning.

Allocate time to watch lectures, and try and limit all distractions while watching lectures

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Use libraries and frameworks that are popular and keep the programming assignments easy, but maybe they could
have more of a practical use than simple console and file programs
