Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# 1. When the entered numerator or denominator isn't an integer
# 2. When the entered denominator is 0
# 3. Yes by adding a while loop to get the denominator again while it is 0
